**1.0	Statement.**
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic: a bike-share company in Chicago. It was launched in 2016 and has successfully grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Until now, the company’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Annual membership customers are referred to as members while single day or full day membership customers are referred to as casual riders. The company’s finance analyst concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders, Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers. However, the Director of marketing, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth to the company. So, rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. Therefore there is a need to understand how casual riders and annual members use cyclistic bikes differently in order to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. However, the new marketing strategy must be approved by the company’s executives hence the need to provide recommendations with simple and clear data insights and visualizations.
